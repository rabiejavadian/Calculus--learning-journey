1^(1/3) = ?

#### ChatGPT

The value of $ 1^{1/3} $, the cube root of $ 1 $, has three possible values, depending on the context:

### 1. **The Real Cube Root**

The real cube root of $ 1 $ is simply:
$
1^{1/3} = 1
$

This is because:
$
1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1
$

### 2. **Complex Cube Roots of Unity**

If you're considering the full set of cube roots (in the complex plane), the equation $ x^3 = 1 $ has three solutions, known as the **cube roots of unity**:
$
x = 1, \quad x = \omega, \quad x = \omega^2
$
where:
$
\omega = -\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad \omega^2 = -\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$

These are the roots of the polynomial $ x^3 - 1 = 0 $. Geometrically, these roots lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, spaced $ 120^\circ $ apart.

### Final Answer

- If you're looking for **only the principal (real) cube root**, $ 1^{1/3} = 1 $.
- If you're looking for **all cube roots**, the answers are:
  $
  1^{1/3} = { 1, , \omega, , \omega^2 }
  $
