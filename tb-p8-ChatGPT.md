# Square Root Differences

#### You:
(sqrt(a))^2
vs
sqrt(a^2)

#### ChatGPT:
The two expressions $(\sqrt{a})^2$ and $\sqrt{a^2}$ may look similar but are not necessarily equivalent. Hereâ€™s the difference:

1. **$(\sqrt{a})^2$**:
   - When you square a square root, you get the original number back.
   - So, $(\sqrt{a})^2 = a$.
   - This is valid for both positive and negative values of $a$.

2. **$\sqrt{a^2}$**:
   - Here, you take the square root of $a^2$.
   - The square root function returns the *non-negative* value (principal square root), so $\sqrt{a^2} = |a|$.
   - This expression will always yield a non-negative result, even if $a$ is negative.

In summary:

- $(\sqrt{a})^2 = a$,
- $\sqrt{a^2} = |a|$.

So, these expressions are equal only when $a \geq 0$; otherwise, they differ.
