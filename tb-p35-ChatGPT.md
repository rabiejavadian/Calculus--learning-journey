# Domain of Composite Functions

#### You:
about composite functions, if it's correct:
"The domain of fog(x) consists of those numbers x in the domain of g for which g(x) is in the domain of f. "
why for example f(x) = sqrt(x) and g(x)=x+1, domain of f is [0, infinity) but domain of fog(x) = sqrt(x+1) is [-1, infinity) which does not belong to [0, infinity) i.e. domain of f, why do we say "consists of those numbers x in the domain of g"?

#### ChatGPT:
The statement you gave about the domain of $ f \circ g $ (i.e., $ f(g(x)) $) is indeed correct, but let's break it down carefully with your example.

### Statement Breakdown:

"The domain of $ f \circ g $ consists of those numbers $ x $ in the domain of $ g $ for which $ g(x) $ is in the domain of $ f $."

This means that:

1. We first look at the domain of $ g $, since we can only consider values of $ x $ for which $ g(x) $ is defined.
2. Then, for each $ x $ in the domain of $ g $, we must check whether $ g(x) $ falls within the domain of $ f $, so that $ f(g(x)) $ is defined.

Let's apply this reasoning to your example.

### Example Walkthrough

Given:
- $ f(x) = \sqrt{x} $, so the domain of $ f $ is $ [0, \infty) $ (we need $ x \geq 0 $ for the square root to be defined).
- $ g(x) = x + 1 $, so the domain of $ g $ is $ (-\infty, \infty) $ (any real number $ x $ works for $ g $).

Now we analyze $ f(g(x)) $:

- We have $ f(g(x)) = f(x + 1) = \sqrt{x + 1} $.
- For $ \sqrt{x + 1} $ to be defined, we need $ x + 1 \geq 0 $, which simplifies to $ x \geq -1 $.

### Domain of $ f \circ g $
So, for $ f(g(x)) = \sqrt{x + 1} $ to be defined:

1. $ x $ must be in the domain of $ g $, which is $ (-\infty, \infty) $.
2\. Additionally, $ g(x) = x + 1 $ must be in the domain of $ f $, which requires $ x + 1 \geq 0 $.

Combining these two conditions, we find that $ x \geq -1 $ for $ f(g(x)) $ to be defined. Therefore, the domain of $ f \circ g $ is $ \[-1, \infty) $.

### Summary

The key idea here is that the domain of $ f \circ g $ is determined by:

1. The domain of $ g $ (since we need $ g(x) $ to be defined).
2. The condition that $ g(x) $ lies within the domain of $ f $ (so that $ f(g(x)) $ is defined).

In this example, $ x \in [-1, \infty) $ satisfies both conditions, giving us the domain of $ f \circ g $ as $ [-1, \infty) $, even though the domain of $ f $ itself is $ \[0, \infty) $.


#### You:
rephrase "The domain of fog(x) consists of those numbers x in the domain of g for which g(x) is in the domain of f. " for clear definition of fog

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s a rephrased definition of the domain of $ f \circ g $:

"The domain of $ f \circ g(x) $ is the set of all values of $ x $ for which $ x $ is in the domain of $ g $, and $ g(x) $ is in the domain of $ f $."

This version emphasizes that we’re looking for values of $ x $ that meet both criteria:
1. $ x $ must be valid in $ g(x) $.
2. $ g(x) $ must be valid in $ f(x) $.

Let me know if this clears things up!
