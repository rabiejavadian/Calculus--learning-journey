# Factoring cubic polynomial

#### You:
find the factors of:
x^3 - x*2 - 4x + 4 = 0

#### ChatGPT:
To find the factors of the cubic polynomial $ x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 $, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Group the terms for factoring

Group terms to try factoring by grouping:
$
x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x^3 - x^2) - (4x - 4)
$

Factor each group:
$
= x^2(x - 1) - 4(x - 1)
$

### Step 2: Factor out the common term
Now factor out the common factor $ (x - 1) $:
$
x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 1)(x^2 - 4)
$

### Step 3: Factor further if possible
The second factor $ x^2 - 4 $ is a difference of squares, so it can be factored as:
$
x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)
$

Thus, the complete factorization is:
$
x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 2)
$

### Step 4: Verify the factors
To verify, expand $ (x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 2) $ to check if it equals the original polynomial. This confirms the solution.

### Final Answer:
The factors of $ x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4 $ are:
$
(x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 2)
$
