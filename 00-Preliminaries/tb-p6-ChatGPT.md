# Inequalities Comparison Analysis

#### You:
are these two inequalities (2 / ( x - 1 ) ) >= 5 and 2 >= (5x - 5) are equivalent?

#### ChatGPT:
Let's analyze each inequality separately to see if they're equivalent.

1. **First Inequality**:\
   $
   \frac{2}{x - 1} \geq 5
   $

   To solve this inequality, we can first multiply both sides by $ x - 1 $, but we need to consider the sign of $ x - 1 $ (because the direction of the inequality changes if we multiply by a negative number).

   - If $ x - 1 > 0 $ (i.e., $ x > 1 $), we multiply both sides by $ x - 1 $:
     $
     2 \geq 5(x - 1)
     $
     which simplifies to:
     $
     2 \geq 5x - 5
     $

   - If $ x - 1 < 0 $ (i.e., $ x < 1 $), we multiply both sides by $ x - 1 $ and reverse the inequality:
     $
     2 \leq 5(x - 1)
     $
     which simplifies to:
     $
     2 \leq 5x - 5
     $

2. **Second Inequality**:
   $
   2 \geq 5x - 5
   $

The second inequality appears in the solution process of the first inequality but only for $ x > 1 $. Therefore, the inequalities are *not entirely equivalent* because the first inequality has conditions depending on the sign of $ x - 1 $, while the second inequality holds regardless of the value of $ x $.

So, they are not equivalent, as the first inequality has a more complex solution set than the second.
